                                             Introduction to AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials

***************************************************************************************************************************************

* AWS cloud knowledge by learning about 
  (01) AWS Cloud concepts
  (02) AWS services
  (03) security
  (04) architecture
  (05) pricing
  (06) Support
  
****************************************************************************************************
  
* AWS offers a massive range of services for every business, starting with basic elements, like
  compute, 
  storage and 
  network security tools, through 
  complex solutions like 
  block chain,
  machine learning,
  or artifiical intelligence and 
  robot developement platforms, all the way thourgh very specialized tool sets,like 
  video production management systems, and 
  orbital satellites you can rent by the minute. 
  
****************************************************************************************************
   
*  In computing, a client (webbrowser or desktop application). A server ( Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud EC2) -  a type of virtual server.

*  Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. 

* At AWS, we call that the undifferentiated heavy lifting of IT. Tasks that are common, often repetitive and ultimately time-consuming;
  there are the tasks AWS wants to help you with. So you can focus on that makes you unique. Over the internet, seeems with simple enough,
  but it implies that you can access resources using a secure webpage console or programmatically.
  
****************************************************************************************************
  
* Deployment models for cloud computing 
  - When selecting a cloud strategy, a company must consider factors such as required 
    (01) cloud application components
	(02) preferred resources management tools, and 
	(03) any legacy IT infrastructure requirement.
	
****************************************************************************************************
	
  - The three cloud computing deployement models are cloud-based, on-premises, and hybrid
  
 (01) cloud based deployement 
       - you can migrate existing applications to the cloud, or you can design and build new applications in the cloud.
	     (01) you can build those applications on low-level infrastructure that requires your IT staff to manage them.
	     (02) you can build those applications on high-level services that reduce that 
		      - management, 
			  - architecting and 
			  - scaling requirements of the core infrastructure.
       - Example : A company might create an application consisting of virtual servers, databases, and networking components that are 
	               fully based in the cloud. 
 
 (02) On-premises deployment 
       - It is also known as a private cloud deployment.
       - In this model, resources are deployed on premises by using 
	     (01) virtualization and 
		 (02) resource management tools.
       - Example : you might have applications that run on technology that is fully kept in your on-premises data center.
                   Though this model is much like legacy IT infrastructure, its incorporation of application management 
                   and virtualization technologies helps to increase resource utilization.
  
 (03) Hydrid deployment
	- cloud based resources are connected to on-premises infrastructure.
        - Example 1: You have legacy applications that are better maintained on premises, or government regulations require
                     your business to keep certain records on premises.
        - Example 2: With a hybrid deployement, the company would be able to keep the legacy applications on premises 
                     while benefiting from the data and analytics services that run in the cloud.

********************************************************************************************************

* Benefits of cloud computing

(01) Trade upfront expenses for variable expense ( companies can implement innovative ideas)
(02) Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers ( focus more on your application and customers) 
(03) Stop guessing capacity
     Example : you can launch Amazon EC2 instances when needed, and pay only for the compute time you use.
               Instead of paying for unused resources or having to deal with limited capacity, you can access only the capacity that you need.
               You can also scale in or scale out in response to demand.
(04) Benefit from massive economies of scale
     - By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own.
     - Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers can aggregate in the cloud, providers,
       such as AWS, can achieve higher economies of scale.
     - The economy of scale translates into lower pay-as-you-go prices.
(05) Increase speed and agility 
     - The flexibility of cloud computing makes it easier for you to develop and deploy applications.
     - This flexibility provides you with more time to experiment and innovate.
     - When computing in data centers, it may take weeks to obtain new resources that you need. By comparsion,cloud computing enables
       you to access new resources within minutes.
(06) Go global in minutes
     - If you are located in a different part of the world than your customers,customers are able to access your applications
       with minimal delays.
  
***************************************************************************************************************************************

1, what is cloud computing?
A, On-demand delivery of IT resources and applications through the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

Other Option:
1, It is possible to back up files to the cloud.
2, Deploying applications connected to on-premises infrastructure is a sample use case for a hybrid cloud deployment.
   Cloud computing also has cloud and on-premises deployment models.
3, AWS Lambda is an AWS service that lets you run code without needing to manage or provision servers.

2, What is another name for on-premises deployment?
A, Private cloud deployment

Other Option:
1, Cloud based applications are fully deployed in the cloud and do not have any parts that run on premises.
2, A hydrid depolyment connects infrastructure and applications between cloud-based resources and existing resources
   that are in the cloud, such as on-premises resources. However, a hybrid deployment is not equivalent
   to an on-premises deployment because it involves resources that are located in the cloud.
3, The AWS cloud offers three cloud depolyment models: cloud, hybrid, and on-premises.

3, How does the scale of cloud computing help you to save costs?
A, The aggreaged cloud usage from a large number of customers results in lower pay-as-you-go prices.

Other Option:
1, Not having to invest in technology resources before using them relates to "Trade upfront expense for variable expense".
2, Accessing services on-demand to prevent excess or limited capacity relates to stop guessing capacity.
3, Quickly deploying applicatons to customers and providing them with low latency relates to Go global in minutes.

                              Introduction to Amazon EC2

********************************************************************************************************************************

* You need raw compute capacity to host your applications and provide the compute power that your businees needs.
  When you're working with AWS, those servers are virtual. And the service you use to gain access to virtual servers is called EC2.
  
* Using EC2 for compute is highly flexible, cost effective and quick.

* EC2 runs on top of physical host machines managed by AWS using virtualization technology. 

* When you spin up an EC2 instance, you aren't necessarily taking an entire host to yourself. Instead, you are sharing the host with   
  multiple other instances, otherwise known as virtual machines. And a hypervisor running on the host machine is responsible for 
  sharing the underlying physical resources between the virtual machines. This idea of sharing underlying hardware is called
  multitenancy. The hypervisor is responsible for isolating the virtual machines from each other as they share resources from the host.
  
* You also have the flexibiliy and control over the configuration of those instances. When you provision an EC2 instance, you can
  choose the operating system based on either windows or Linux. You can provision thousands of EC2 instances on demand. With a blend
  of operating systems and configurations to power your business different applications.

* EC2 instances are also resizable. You might start with a small instance, realize the application you are running is starting to max out that server,
  and then you can give that instance more memory and more CPU. Which is what we call vertically scaling an instance.
  
* You can also control the networking aspect of EC2. So what type of requests make it to your server and if they are publicly or privately accessible
  is something you decide.
  
* Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud as Amazon EC2 instances.

* How Amazon EC2 works

  (01) Launch 
       - First, you launch an instance. Begin by selecting a template with basic configurations for your instance.
	     These configurations include the operating system, application server, or application.
		 You also select the instance type, which is the specific hardware configuration of your instance.
		 As you are preparing a launch an instance, you specify security settings to control the network traffic that
		 can flow into and out of your instance.
		 
  (02) Connect 
       - Next, connect to instance. You can connect to the instance in several ways. 
	   - Your programs and applicatin have multiple different methods to connect directly to the instance and exchange data.
	   - Users can also connect to the instance by logging in and accessing the computer desktop.
	   
  (03) Use 
       - After you have connected to the instance, you can begin using it.
	   - You can run commands to install software, add storage, copy and organize files, and more.
	   
* Amazon EC2 Instance Types : 

- When selecting an instance type, consider the specific needs of your workloads and applications.
- Instance types offer varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage and networking capacity, and give you the flexibility to choose 
  the appropriate mix of resources for your applications.
- The different instance families in EC2 are 
  (01) General purpose instances:
       - provide a good balance of compute, memory and networking resources, and can be used for a variety of diverse workloads like
	     web service or code repositories
	   - you can use them for a variety of workloads, such as:
	     (01) application servers
		 (02) gaming server
		 (03) backend servers for enterprise applications
		 (04) small and medium database
  (02) Compute optimized instances:
       - are ideals for compute-intensive tasks like gaming servers, high performance computing or HPC, and even scientific modeling. 
  (03) Memory optimized instances:
       - are good for memory-intensive tasks.
  (04) Accelerated computing:
       - are good for floating point number calculations, graphics processing, or data pattern matching, as they use hardware accelerators.
  (05) Storage optimized :
       - Workloads that require high performance for locally stored data.

*******************************************************************************************************************************************

                                       Amazon EC2 Pricing 

******************************************************************************************************************************************* 

* Amazon EC2 offers a variety of pricing options for different use cases.
- Example : if your use case can withstand interruptions, you can save with spot instances. You can also save by committing early and locking in a minimum
  level of use with Reserved Instances.
  
1, On-Demand
   
- On-Demand instances are ideal for short-term, irregular workloads that cannot be interruped.
- No upfront costs or minimum contracts apply.
- The instances run continuously until you stop them, and you pay for only the compute time you use.

- Sample use cases for On Demand instances include developing and testing applications and running applications that have unpredictable usage patterns.
- On-Demand instances are not recommanded for workloads that a year or longer because these workloads can experience greater cost savings using Reserverd instances.

2, Reserved Instances :

- Reserved instances are a billing discount applied to the use of on-demand instances in your account.
- These are two available types of Reserved instances:
  (01) Standard Reserved Instances (02) Convertiable Reserved instances
  
- You can purchase Standard Reserved and Convertiable Reserved Instances for a 1-year or 3-year term.
- You realize greater cost savings with the 3-year option.

(a) Standard Reserved Instances:

- This is a good fit if you know 
  (i) Instance type and size: For example, m3.xlarge
  (ii) Platform description (operating system): For example, Microsoft Windows Server or Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  (iii) Tenancy: Default tenancy or dedicated tenancy
- You have the option to specify an Availability Zone for your EC2 Reserved instances.  If you make this specification, you get EC2 capacity reserveration.
  This ensures that your desired amount of EC2 instances will be available when you need them.
  
(b) Convertible Reserver Instances:

- If you need to run your EC2 instances in different Availability Zones or different instance types, then convertible Reserved instances might be right for you.
- You trade in a deeper discount when you require flexibility to run your EC2 instances.

- At the end of a Reserved Instance term, you can continue using the Amazon EC2 instance without interruption. However, you are charged on-demand rates until
 you do one of the following:
 
 1, Terminate the instance.
 2, Purchase a new Reserved Instance that matches the instance attribute (instance family and size, Region, platform, and tenancy)

3, EC2 instance Savings Plans

- AWS offers Savings Plans for a few compute services, including Amazon EC2.
- EC2 instance Savings Plans reduce your EC2 instance costs when you make an hourly spend commitment to 
  an instance family and region for a 1-year or 3-year term.
- This term commitment results in savings of up to 72 percent compared to On-Demand rates.
- Any usage up to the commitment is charged at the discounted savings plans rate. Any usage beyond the commitment is charged at regular On-Demand rates.
- The EC2 instance savings plans are a good option if you need flexibility in your Amazon EC2 usage over the duration of the commitment term.
- You have the benefit of saving costs on running any EC2 instance within an EC2 instance family in a chosen Region regardless of Availability Zone,
   instance size, OS or tenancy.
- The savings with EC2 instance savings plans are similar to the saving provided by Standard Reserved Instances.
- Unlike Reserved Instances, however, you don't need to specify up front what EC2 instance type and size, OS and tenancy to get a discount. Further,
  you don't need to commit to a certain number of EC2 instances over a 1-year or 3-year term. Additionally, the EC2 instance savings plans don't include
  an EC2 capacity reservation option.
- You'll review AWS Cost Explorer, which you can use to visualize,understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time.
- AWS Cost Explorer also provides customized recommendations for saving plans.
- These recommendations estimate how much you could save on your monthly Amazon EC2 costs, based on previous Amazon EC2 usage and the hourly commitment 
  amount in a 1-year or 3-year savings plan.
  
4, Spot instance 

-  Spot instances are ideal for workloads with flexible start and end times, or that can withstand interruptions.
-  Spot instances unused Amazon EC2 computing capacity and offer you cost savings at up to 90% off of On-Demand prices.

5, Dedicated Hosts

- Dedicated Hosts are physical servers with Amazon EC2 instance capacity that is fully dedicated to your use.
- You can purchase on-demand dedicated hosts and dedicated hosts reservations.
- Of all the Amazon EC2 options that were covered, dedicated hosts are the most expensive.


1, Which Amazon EC2 pricing option provides a discount when you specify a number of EC2 instances to run a specific OS,
   instance family and size, and tenancy in one region?
A, Standard Reserved instances

2, Which Amazon EC2 pricing option provides a discount when you make an hourly spend commitment to an instance family and region
   for a 1-year or 3-year term?
A, EC2 instance savings plans
