// How to create variables:
var x;
let y;

//How to use variables:
x = 5;
y = 6;
let z = x + y;

- JavaScript Values
* The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:
(01) Fixed values  (02) Variable values
* Fixed values are called Literals.
* Variable values are called Variables.

- JavaScript Literals
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <body>
  <h2>JavaScript Numbers</h2>
  <p>Number can be written with or without decimals.</p>
  <p id="demo1"></p>
  <p id="demo2"></p>
  <script>
	  document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = 10.50; or 1001;
	  document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = 'John Doe' or "John Doe"; 
  </script>
  </body>
  </html>

- JavaScript Variables
* Variables are used to store data values.
* JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.
* An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h2>JavaScript Variables</h2>
<p>In this example, x is defined as a variable.
Then, x is assigned the value of 6:</p>
<p id="demo"></p>
<script>
let x;
x = 6;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
</script>
</body>
</html>

- JavaScript Expressions

* 5 * 10

* x * 10

* The values can be various types, such as numbers and strings.
* "John" + " " + "Doe"

- JavaScript Keywords
* JavaScript keywords are used to identify actions to be performed.
* The let keyword tells the browser to certain variables:
  let x,y;
  x = 5 + 6;
  y = x * 10;
* The var keyword also tells the browser to create varibles.
  var x,y;
  x = 5+6;
  y = x * 10;
  
- JavaScript Comments
* Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment.


- JavaScript Identifiers/Names
* A JavaScript name must begin with:
  - A letter (A-Z or a-z)
  - A dollar sign($)
  - Or an underscore(_)
  - Numbers are not allowed as the first character in names.
  - Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
  
- Javascript is Case Sensitive
  * The variables lastName and lastname, are two different variables.
  
- JavaScript and Camel Case
  * Historically, programmers have used different ways of joining multiple words into one variable name:
  * Hyphens : Hyphens are not allowed in Java Script. They are reserved for substractions.
  * Underscore : first_name,last_name,master_card,inter_city
  * Upper Camel Case(Pascal Case): FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity.
  * Lower Camel Case: JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter:
	firstName,lastName,masterCard,interCity.

- JavaScript Character Set
  * JavaScript uses the unicode character set.
  * Unicode covers (almost) all the characters,punctuations and symbols in the world.
