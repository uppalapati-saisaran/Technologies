- In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags.

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript";
</script>

- Old JavaScript examples may use a type attribute: <script type="text/javascript">.
- The type attribute is not required. JavaScript is the default scripting language in HTML.

- JavaScript Function is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for.
  For example, a function can be called when an event occurs, like when the user clicks a button.
  
  
- JavaScript in <head> or <body>
  You can place any numer of scripts in an HTML document.
  Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.
  
- JavaScript in <head>
  The function is invoked(called) when a button is clicked.
  
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <head>
	<script>
	function myFunction() {
		document.getElementById("demo").innerHTMK = "Paragraph changed.";
	}
	</script>
  </head>
  <body>
  <h2>Demo JavaScript in Head</h2>
  <p id="demo">A Paragraph</p>
  <button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Try it</buttion>
  </body>
  </html>
  
- JavaScript in <body>
  The function is invoked(called) when a button is clicked.
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <body>
	<h2>Demo JavaScript in Body</h2>
	<p id="demo">A Paragraph</p>
	<button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>
  <script>
  function myFunction() {
	document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML="Paragraph changed.";
  }
  </script>
  </body>
  </html>
  Placing scripts at the bottom of the <body> element improves the display speed, because script interpretation slows down the display.
  
- Scripts can also be placed in external files:
  myScript.js
  function myFunction() {
	document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Paragraph changed.";
  }
  * External scripts are practical when the same code is used in many different web pages.
  * JavaScript files have the file extension .js.
  * To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of a <script> tag:
  <script src="myScript.js"></script>
  * You can place an external script reference in <head> or <body> as you like.
  * The script will behave as if it was located exactly where the <script> tag is located.
  * External scripts cannot contain <script> tags.
  * External scripts in external files has some advantages:
	(01) It separates HTML and code.
	(02) It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain.
	(03) Cached JavaScript files can spped up page loads.
  * To add several script files to one page - use several script tags:
    <script src="myScript1.js"></script>
  	<script src="myScript2.js"></script>  
  * A external script can be referenced in 3 different ways:
    (01) With a full URL ( a full web address)
	 <script src="https://wwww.w3schools.com/js/myScript.js"></script>
    (02) With a file path
	 <script src="/js/myScript.js"></script>
	(03) Without any path
	 <script src="myScript.js"></script>
