- A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.
- In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser.
- JavaScript statements are composed of: Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and comments.
- This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly" inside an HTML element with id="demo"

  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly.";
  
- Semicolons;
  * Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.
  * Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement.
  let a,b,c;  // Declare 3 variables
  a = 5; // Assign the value 5 to a
  b = 6; // Assign the value 6 to b
  c = a + b; // Assign the sum of a and b to c 
  
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <body>
  <h2>JavaScript Statment</h2>
  <p> JavaScript statments are separated by semicolons.</p>
  <p id="demo"></p>
  <script>
  let a,b,c;
  a = 5;
  b = 6;
  c = a+b;
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = c;
  </script>
  </body>
  </html>
  
  
- JavaScript White Space
  
  // The following lines are equivalent. 
  let person = "Hege";
  let person="Hege";
  
- JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks
  
  //If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator: 
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
  "Hello Dolly!";
  
- JavaScript Code Blocks
  
  //JavaScript statments can be grouped together in code blocks,inside curly brackets {...}.
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <body>
	<h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>
	<p>JavaScript code blocks are written between { and }</p>
	<button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Click Me!</button>
	<p id="demo1"></p>
	<p id="demo2"></p>
	<script>
	function myFunction(){
		document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly!";
		document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = "How are you?";
	}
	</script>
  </body>
  </html>
