  <html>
  <body>
  <h2>JavaScript const</h2>
  <p id="demo"></p>
  <script>
  try {
  const PI = 3.141593;
  PI = 3.14;
  }
  catch(err) {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = err;
  }
  </script>
  </body>
  </html>

* Must be Assigned 

  JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared:
  const PI = 3.14159265359;
  Incorrect:
  const PI;
  PI = 3.141592;
