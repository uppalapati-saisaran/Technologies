                             Introduction to cloud computing 

*****************************************************************************************************************************

What is cloud computing?

- Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet.
- Cloud computing services includes IT infrastructure such as virtual machines,storage,databases and networking.
- Cloud services also expand the traditional IT offerings to include things like Internet of Things(IoT), machine learning (ML)
  and artifical intelligence(AI).
  
Describe the shared responsibility model ?

- With the shared responsibility model, these responsibilities get shared between the cloud provider and consumer.
- The phyical security, power, cooling, and network connectivity are the responsibility of the cloud provider.
- The consumer isn't collocated with the datacenter, so it wouldn't make sense for the consumer to have any of those responsilibities.
  * At the same time, the consumer is responsible for the data and information stored in the cloud.
  * The consumer is also responsible for access security, meaning you only give access to those who need it.
  * At the same things, the responsilibility depends on the situation.
  
- The shared responsilibility model is heavily tied into the cloud service types: 
  (01) Infrastructure as a service (Iaas) (02) Platform as a service (Paas) (03) Software as a service (Saas)
  
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-cloud-compute/4-describe-shared-responsibility-model

- Infrastructure as a service (Iaas) places the most responsibility on the consumer, with the cloud provider being responsiable
  for the basics of physical security, power, and connectivity.
- Software as a service (Saas)  places most of the responsibility with the cloud provider.
- Platform as a service (Paas) being a middle ground between Iaas and Saas,
  rests somewhere in the middle and evenly distributes responsibility between the cloud
  provider and the consumer.

- When using a cloud provider, you'll always be responsible for:
  (01) The information and data stored in the cloud.
  (02) Devices that are allowed to connect to our cloud
       (cell phones, computers, and so on)
  (03) The accounts and identifies of the people,services, and 
       devices within your organization.
	   
- The cloud provider is always responsible for:
  The physical datacenter, the physical network and the physical hosts.
  
- Your service model will determine responsibility for things like:
  Operating systems, Network controls, Applications, Identity and infrastruture
  
Define cloud models?

- The cloud models define the deployment type of cloud resources. 
- The threee main models are: private, public, and hybrid.

(01) Private cloud
- Private cloud provides much greater control for the company and its IT deparment. However, it also comes with greater cost and 
  fewer of the benefits of a public cloud deployment.
- A private cloud may be hosted from your onsite datacenter.
- It may also be hosted in a dedicated datacenter offsite, potentially even by a third party that has dedicated that datacenter
  to your company.
  
  * Organizations have complete control over resources and security.
  * Data is not collocated with other organizations' data
  * Hardware must be purchased for startup and maintenance
  * Organisations are responsible for hardware maintence and updates.

(02) Public cloud 
- The general public availability is a key difference between public 
  and private clouds.
  
  * No capital expenditures to scale up.
  * Applications ca be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned.
  * Organizations pay only for what they use.
  * Organizations don't have complete control over resources and security.

(03) Hybrid cloud
- A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that uses both public and private clouds in an interconnected envirnoment. 

  * Provides the most flexibility
  * Organisations determine where to run their applications.
  * Organisations control security, compliance, or legal requirements.
  

(04) Multi-cloud
- You deal with two public cloud providers and manage resources and 
  security in both environments.
  
Azura Arc
- Azura Arc is a set of technologies that helps manage your cloud environment.

Azure VMware Solution 
- VMware in a private cloud environment but want to migrate to a public
  or public or hybrid cloud? Azure VMware solutions lets you run your VMware
  workloads in Azura with seamless integration and scalability.
  
Describe the consumpation-based model :
- When comparting IT infrastructure models, there are two types of expenses to consider.
  (01) Capital expenditure : is typically a one-time, up-front expenditure to purchase or secure tangible resources.
  (02) Operational expenditure : is spending money on services or products over time.
 
- Cloud computing falls under OpEx because cloud computing operates on a consumption-based model.
- This consumpation-based model has many benefits, including.
  (01) No upfront costs.
  (02) No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that user might not use to its fullest potential.
  (03) The ability to pay for more resources when they're needed.
  (04) The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.
  
Compare cloud pricing models
  
- You typically pay only for the cloud services you use,which helps you
  (01) Plan and manage your operating costs.
  (02) Run your infrastructure more efficiently.
  (03) Scale as your business needs change.

******************************************************************************************************************

          Describe the benefits of using cloud services 

******************************************************************************************************************
  

* When building and deploying a cloud application, two of the biggest considerations are uptime (or availbility) and ability to handle demand (or scale). 

1, High availability :

- High availabiliy focuses on ensureing maximum availiablility, regardless of disruptions or events that may occur.
- When you're architecting your solution, you'll need to account for service availability guarantees.
- These guarantees are part of the service level aggrements(SLAs).

2, Scalability: 

- Major benefit of cloud computing is the scalability of cloud resources.
- The other benefit of scalability is that you aren't overpaying for services.
- Scalability generally comes in two varieties: vertical and horizontal. 

a, Vertical Scaling:

- With veritcal scaling, if you were developing an app and you needed more processing power, you could vertially scale up to 
  add more CPUs or RAM to the virtual machine. 
  
b, Horizontal scaling:

- you could add additional virtual machines or containers, scaling out. 

3, Reliability :

- Reliability is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function.
- The cloud by virtue of its decentralized design, naturally supports a reliable and resilient infrastructure.


4, Predictability :

- Predictability in the cloud lets you move forward with confidence.
- Predictability can be focused on performance predictability or cost predictability.

a, Performance: 
-  Performance predicatability focuses on predicting the resources needed to deliever a positive experience for you customers.
-  Autoscaling, load balaning, ahd high availability are just some of the cloude concepts that support performance predictability.

b, cost: 
- Cost predictability is focused on predicting or forecasting the cost of the cloud spend.
- You can even use tools like the Total Cost of Ownership(TCO) or Pricing Calculator to get an estimate of potential cloud spend.

5, Security and governance in the cloud

- Whether you're deploying infrastructure as a service or software as a service, cloud features support governance and compliance.
- Things like set templates help ensure that all your deployed resources meet corporate standards and government regulatory requirements. Plus, you can update
  all your deployed resources to new standards as standards change.
- Cloud based auditing helps flag any resource that's out of compilance with our corporate standards and provide mitigation strategies.
- Depending on your operating model, software patches and updates may also automatically be applied, which helps with both goverance and security.

- On the security side, if you want maximum control of security, infrastructure as a service provides you with physical resources but lets you manage the 
  operating systems and installed software, including patches and maintenance.
- If you want patches and maintence taken care of automatically, platform as a service or software as a service deployments may be the best cloud strategies for you.
- Cloud is inteneded as an over-the-internet delivery of IT resources, cloud providers are typically well suited to handle things like disturbed denial of service (DDOS)
  attacks, making your network more robust and secure.

- By establishing a good goverance footprint early, you can keep your cloud foot print updated,secure, and well managed.

								Benefits of manageability in the cloud 

*****************************************************************************************************************************************

- A major benefit of cloud computing is the manageability options.
- There are two types of manageability for cloud computing.

1, Management of the cloud

- Management of the cloud speaks to managing your cloud resources. In the cloud, you can:
1, Automatically scale resource deployment based on need.
2, Deploy resources based on a preconfigured template, removing the need for manual configuration.
3, Monitor the health of resources and automatically replace failing resources.
4, Receive automatic alerts based on configured metrics, so you're aware of performance in real time.

2, Management in the cloud 

- Management in the cloud speaks to how you're able to manage your cloud environment and resources.
- You can manage these:
1, Through a web portal
2, using a command line interface
3, Using APIs
4, Using PowerShell 

**********************************************************************************************************************************************


1, Which type of scaling involves adding or removing resources (such as virtual machines or containers) to meet demand?
A, Horizontal scaling - is adding or substracting the number of resources. 

2, What is characterized as the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function>
A, Reliability  - is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function, and it is one of the 
   the pillars of the Microsoft Azura Well-Architected Framework.
   
   
**********************************************************************************************************************************************

                                    Describe Infrastructure as a Service 
									
**********************************************************************************************************************************************

- Infrastructure as a service is the most flexible category of cloud services,as it provides you the maximum amount of control for your cloud resources.
- In an Iaas model, the cloud provider is responsible for maintaining the hardware, network connectivity and physical security. You're responsible 
  for everything else: operating system installation, and maintenance, network configuration, database and storage configuration and so on.
- With IaaS, you are essentially renting the hardware in a cloud datacenter, but what you do with that hardeware is up to you.

- Some common scenarios where Iaas might make sense include:

1, Lift and shift migration: you're setting up cloud resources similar to your on-prem datacenter, and then simply
   moving the things running on-prem to running on the Iaas infrastructure.
   
2, Testing and development : you have established configurations for development and test environments that you need to rapidly replicate.
   You can start up or shut down the different environments rapidly with an Iaas structure while maintaining complete control.
   
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************

                                 Describe Platform as a Service 

*****************************************************************************************************************************************************
	
- Platform as a service is a middle ground between renting space in a data center and paying for a complete and deployed solution.
- In a Paas environment, the cloud provider maintains the physical infrastructure, physical security and connection to the internet.They also maintian the 
  operating systems, middleware, developement tools, and business intelligence services that make up a cloud solution.
- In a Paas scenario, you don't have to worry about the licensing or patching for operating systems and databases.
- Paas is well suited to provide a complete development environment without the headache of maintaining all the developement infrastructure.

- Depending on the configuration,you or the cloud provider may be responsible for networking settings and connectivity within your cloud envirnoment,
  network and application security and the directory infrastructure.
  
- Some common scenerios where Paas migh make sense include:

1, Developement framework : Paas provides a framework that developers can build upon to develop or customize cloud based applications.
   Similar to the way you create an excel macro, Paas lets developers create applications using built-in software components. Cloud features
   such as scability, high availability, and multi-tenant capability are included, reducing the amount of coding that developers must be.
2, Analytics or business intelligence: Tools provided as a service with Paas allow organizations to analyze and mine their data, finding insights
   and patterns and predicting outcomes to improve forecasting,product design decisions, investment returns and other busineess decisions.
   
   
 *****************************************************************************************************************************************************
 
                             Describe Software as a service 
 
 ******************************************************************************************************************************************************

- Software as a service is the most complete cloud service model from a product perspective.
- With Saas, you're essentially renting or using a fully developed application.
- Email, finanical software, messaging applications and connectivity software are all common example of a Saas implementation.
- While the Saas model may be the least flexible, it is also the easiest to get up and running. It requires the least amount of 
  technical knowledge or expertise to fully employ.
  
- Some common scenerios for Saas are:

1, Email and messaging
2, Business productivity applications.
3, Finance and expense tracking.

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

1, Which cloud service type is most suited to a lift and shift migration from on on-premises data center to a cloud deployment?
A, With an Iaas service type, you can approximate your on-premises environment, making a lift and shift tranition to the cloud relatively straightforward.

2, What type of cloud service type would a Finance and expense tracking solutions typically be in?
A, Saas provides access to software solutions, such as finance and expense tracking, email or ticketing systems.
