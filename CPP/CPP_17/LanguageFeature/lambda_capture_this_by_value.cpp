Lambda capture this by value:

- Capturing this is a lambda's environment was previously reference-only.

- An example of where this is problematic is asynchronous code using callbacks that require an object to be available, potentially pass its lifetime. 

- *this will now make a copy of the current object, while this(C++11) continues to capture by reference.

  struct MyObj{
    int value {123};
	auto getValueCopy() {
		return [*this] { return value; };
	}
	auto getValueRef(){
		return [this] { return value; };
	}
  };
  
  MyObj mo;
  auto valueCopy = mo.getValueCopy();
  auto valueRef = mo.getValueRef();
  mo.value = 321;
  valueCopy(); //123
  valueRef(); //321
