Move semanics:

- Moving an object means to transfer ownership of some resource it manages to another object.

Benefits : 
         (01) when an object is about to reach the end of its lifetime, either because it's temporary or by explicitly calling std::move,
		      a move is often a cheapter way to transfer resources.
		 (02) also make it possible for non-copytable types such as std::unique_ptr s to guarantee at the language leave that there is
		      only ever one instance of a resource being managed at a time, while being able to transfer an instance between scopes.
