Non static data member initializers:

- Allows non-static data members to be initialized where they
  are declared, potentially cleaning up constructors of default
  initializations.
  
 // Default initialization prior to C++11
 class Human {
   Human() : age(0) {}
 private:
   unsigned age;
 };
 
 // Default initialization on C++ 11
 class Human {
	private:
	unsigned age {0};
 };
