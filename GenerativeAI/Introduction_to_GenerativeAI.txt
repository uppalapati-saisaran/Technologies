* DeepLearning => subset => Machine Learning => subset => Artifical intelligence

***************************************************************


* Arttifical intelligence is a discipline
* science is a discipline of artifical intelligence.
* AI is the theroy and development of computer systems able to 
  perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence.
  
***************************************************************
  
* Machine Learning  is subfield
* ML gives computers the ability to learn without explict programming.
* ML models are divided into unsupervised ML models and 
  supervised ML models.

* supervised ML models is labelled data. 
* labelled data comes with tag (i.e, name)
* supervised learning implies the data is already labeled.
* In supervised learning we are learning from past examples
  to predicate future values. 
* classic example of supervised learning:
  
  input data: x ==> Passed to ===> Model ===> PredicateOut(y) 
  ==> Compared with ==> Excepted output(y) [ Training data] 
  ==> If the results are so far then it is the error then
  ==> Modified the data and give back to Model. 
  
* unsupervised ML modesl is unlabelled data.
* unlabelled data comes without tag.
* unsupervised learning implies the data is not labeled.
* unsupervised problems are all about looking at the raw data,
  and seeing if it naturally falls into groups.
* classic example of unsupervised learning: 
  
  input data: x ===> passed to ===> Model ===> Generated example
  
*************************************************************************
  
* Deep learning is a subset of ML. 
* Deep learning uses Aritifical Neural Networks - allowing them to process
  more complex patterns than traditional machine learning.
* input layer ==> hidden layer ==> output layer   

* Generative AI is a subset of Deep Learning.
* Large Language Models (LLMs) are also a subset of Deep Learning.

* Deep Learning model types are divided into
(01) Discriminative
- Used to classify or predict.
- Typically trained on a dataset of labeled data.
- Learns the relationship between the features of the data points
  and labels.
  
(02) Generative
- Generates new data that is similar to data it was trained on.
- Understands distribution of data and how likely a given example   
  is
- Predict next word in a sequence.

  Discriminative technique ---> Classify ( Discriminative model -
  classify as a dog or a cat) ---> Dog

  Generative technique ---> Generate --> Generative model 
  (generate dog image) ---> Dog
  
  Predicative ML Model
   
  Data,Labels -> Predictive ML Model (Learns relationship between
  data and label) --> Output --> Label
  
  Unstructed -> input -> GenAI Model (Learns patterns in unstructed
  content) --> Output --> New Content
  
  
* How to identify deep learning is GenAI or not?
  Input --> ML System --> Output ->
  (01) Not GenAI when y is a: Number, Discrete, Class, Probability
  (02) is GenAI when y is : Natural language, Image, Audio 
  
  y = f(x)
  x - input data
  f - Model
  y - Model output
  
  
* Classical supervised & Unsupervised Learning

  Training code, Labeled data ----> Model Building --->
  
  Predict or classify or cluster
  
* Gen AI Supervised, Semi-Supervised and Unsupervised Learning

  Training code, Labeled data, unlabeled data 
  
  --> Foundation Model --> 
  
  (01) ---> Generate new content ---> Text Generation
  (02) ---> Generate new content ---> Code Generation
  (03) ---> Generate new content ----> Image Generation
  

* Generative language models | LaMDA, PaLM, GPT, etc

* What is Generative AI?
  GenAI is a type of Artifical intelligence that creates new content
  based on what it has learned from existing content.
  
  The process of learning from existing content is called training
  and results in the creation of a statistical model.
  
  When given a prompt, GenAI uses this statistical model to predict
  what an expected response might be-and this generate new content.
  
* Generative language models
  Generative language models learn about patterns in language through training data.
  Then, give some text, they predict what comes next.
  
* Generative image models
  Generative image models produce new images using techniques like diffusion.
  Then, give a prompt or related imagery, they transform random noise into images or generate images from photos.
  

* Input: Image   
  Output: Text image captioning, visual question answering, image captioning 
  Output : Image Super resolution, Image completion  
  Output: Video Animation.
  
* Input: Text 
  Output: Text Translation, summarization, Question Answering, Grammar correction
  Output: Image  Super resolution, Image completion
  Output: Audio Text to speech
  Output: Decisions Play games.

	 * Sure I can help you with that. Here are some of the most popular spreads to put on a peanut butter sandwich:
	    - Jelly or jam: strawberry, grape, raspberry, apricot, peach, blackberry, blueberry, etc.
		
* Power of AI comes from transformer 

  How's it going?  -- input -->  Transformer ( ->  Encoding component -> Decoding component ) 
  --> Generative pre-trained transformer model -- output --> I'm doing alright, thanks for asking. How are you?
  
* Hallucinations make the output text difficult to understand and make the model more likely to generate incorrect or misleading information.
* Hallucinations are bad

* Prompting ( Summarize a text of x, Generate a poem in the style of x, Give me a list of keywords based on semantic similarity of x )
  --> Large Language Model -- Output --> Summarization , Writing, keyword extraction
 
* Generative AI depends a lot on training data.

* Describe large language models use cases.
* Explain prompt tuning and describe google's generative AI development tools

* Large language modesl are a subset of deep learning.
* Generative AI and large language model intersect and they are both a part of deep learning. 

* What are large language models?
- Large language models refer to large general purpose language models that can be pre-trained
  and then fine-tuned for specific purposes.

* What do pre-trained and fine-tuned mean great questions?
- Imagine training a dog often you train your dog basic commands such as sit, come, down and stay these commands
  are normally sufficient for everyday life and help your dog become a good Canan Citizen but if you need
  special service dogs such as a police dog a guide dog or a hunting god you add special trainings right.
  the similar ideal applies to large language models.
  These models are trained for general purposes to solve common language probelms such as text classification question 
  answering document summarization and text generation across

                      					Overview of ML 
***************************************************************************************************************************************

* Generative artifical intelligence is a branch of machine learning. 
* It is concerned with the development of algorithms that can create natural language text, images, code, audio, or videos based on user input.
* Generative AI has numerous applications in various industries, such as media, entertainment, healthcare, and finance. 
 

*****************************************
 What is ML?						
*****************************************

* ML is training a computer to recognize patterns in historical data to make predications on new data.
* These predications are then used to take business actions.
* In pratice, ML progresses as follows: 

	DataSet ->  Recognize Patterns -> Make predicitions

* A dataset is used to train a model. In this dataset, there are features and labels. The goal is to take features as inputs
  and find a formula that predicts the labels or outputs. The resulting ML algorithms can take new data, recognize patterns in the data,
  apply the formula, and make predications about the data.

History of ML at Amazon ?

******************************************

* Many of the Amazon services customers use are driven by ML.
* Our ecommerence recommendations engine is driven by ML.
* The paths that optimize robotic picking routes in our fulfillment centers are driven by ML.
* Our supply chain, forecasting and capacity planning are informed by ML.

* Amazon Prime Air (drone delivery) and the computer vision technology in Amazon Go (a physical retail store without formal check out experience) use deep leanring.
* Amazon Alexa, powered by more than 30 different ML systems, helps customers billions of times each week to manage smart homes, shop, get information and entertainment and more.

******************************************

Understaning the difference between generative AI and traditional ML

******************************************

* Generative AI is a subnet of deep learning because it can adopt models built using deep learning, but without retraining or fine tuning.
* Deep learning uses the concept of neurons and synapses similar to how our brain is wired.
* Example of deep learning applications in Amazon Recognition which can analysze millions of images, streaming and stored videos within seconds.
* Amazon CodeWhisperer, an example of a generative AI application, can generate code suggestions in real time based on your comments and existing code.

* Generative AI is powered by large langugage models that are pretained on internet-scale data, these models are called foundation models(FMs).
  With FMs, instead of gathering labeled data for each model and training multiple models as in tranditional ML, customers can adopt the same FM
  to perform multiple tasks.
  
* The large language models have the ability to predict the next word in a sentence by taking into consideration the position and the context
  of a word in a sentence. LLMs use this ability to generate new context. 
  
******************************************

Evolution of ML and the emergence of generative AI

								Basics of Generative AI 

****************************************************************************************************************************

********************************************

What is generative AI?

********************************************
	  
* Generative AI is a type of AI that can create new content,including conversations, stories, images, videos, music, and code.
* Generative AI is powered by ML models. However, generative AI is powered by very large models that are pretrained on vast  
  collections of data.
* Code generation example:
  - An example of generative AI that businesses are using is Amazon CodeWhisperer [ wis,par,ar / a person who whispers very quietly, so that only people who are close can hear] 
    , the AI coding companion.
  - CodeWhisperer is a generative AI tool that increases developer productivity by generating code.
  
* During the Amazon CodeWhisperer preview, Amazon ran a productivity chanllenge.
* Participants who used CodeWhisper were 27 percent more likely to complete tasks successfully and did so an average
  of 57 percent faster thatn those who didn't use codeWhisperer.
  
* Developers are often forced to break their workflow to search the internet or to ask their colleagues for help completing the task.Although this can 
  help them obtain the starter code they need,it's disruptive [ dis-rap-tive, causing or tending to cause disruption ]. They must leave their integrated
  development environment to search or ask questions in a forum or to find and ask a colleague--further adding to the disruption. 

* Instead, CodeWhisper meets developers where they are most productive, providing real-time recommendations as they write code or comments in their IDE.

* What are customers saying about CodeWhisperer?
  - Accenture uses CodeWhisperer is improve developer productivity, including for developer onboarding, writing boilerplate code,
    using unfamiliar languages, and detecting security vulnerabilities.
  - CodeWhisper to reduce our development efforts by up to 30% and we are now focusing more on improving security, quality, and performance.


* Amazon CodeWhiperper, Free for individual use is now generally available.

										How Amazon uses generative AI 
*************************************************************************************************************************************************

- One of the ways Amazon is using generative AI is with the Create with Alexa feature.
- Create with Alexa uses advances in convervational and generative AI to empower young storyteller to build unique stories with a narrative arc,
  coloreful graphics, and fun, complementary background music.
- The animated storie then come to life on the scren of Amazon Echo Show devices.

- To build these stories, Alexa researchers created several different content generators using generative AI.
- To learn more about the create with Alexa feature, choose the start or arrow buttons to display each of the following three steps.

- The Alexa story creation experience uses AI to arrange visual elements on either artist-rendered or AI-generated backgrounds
  to illustrate stories produced by a separate AI module.
 
Story generation: 

- The story generator includes two models that use pretrained language models.
- The planner model receives the customer-selected prompts and uses them to generate a longer set of keywords that are allocated to separated scenes.
- The keywords constitue the story plan.
- The text generator model receives the story plan and outputs the story text.
- It uses human-written stories labeled according to the themes that cusotmers will ultimately choose from, such as underwater and enchanted forest. 


Scene generation 

- The scene generation text is processed through two natural language processing modules.
- This makes it possible for the module to determine references to pronouns and other indicative words and rewrite the text accordingly.
- Example : if the mermaid mentioned in scene one is referred to as she in scene two, the module rewrites she as the mermaid. 
            This makes it more efficient for the scene generator to interpret the text.
			

Music generation

- An AI musical arragement system ensures that all the pieces fit together based on their attributes, such as chord progression,
  rhythm and instrument type.
  
- A text-to-speech model computes the time it will take to read the text. 
- The model's output serve to help determine the duration and character of the background music.
- A paralinguistic analysis model scores the text along multiple axes, such as claim to exciting and sad to happy.
