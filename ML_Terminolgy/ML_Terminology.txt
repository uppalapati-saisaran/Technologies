Machine Learning Subcategories

1, Supervised Learning - uses a set of input variables to predice the value of an output variable.
2, UnSupervised Learning - uses patterns from any unlabeled dataset, trying to understand patterns (or groupings) in the data.


Machine Learning Phases:

Machine learning has two main phases:

1. Training - Input data are used to calculate the parameters of the model.
2. Inference - The "trained" model outputs correct data from any input. 


Machine Learning Models:

- A model defines the relationship between the label(y) and the features(x)
- There are three phases in the life of a model:
1, Data Collection
2, Training
3, Inference

Machine Learning Training

- The goal of training is to create a model that can answer a question. Like what is the expected price for a house?

Machine Learning Inference

- Inference is when the trained model is used to infer(predict) values using live data. Like putting the model into production.

Supervised Learning :
What is spam in an email", based on know spam examples.
- Supervised learning can predict outcomes like predicting what kind of video you like, based on the videos you have played. 

UnSupervised Learning:
- Supervised Learning uses labeled data (data with known answers) to train algorithms to:
  (01) Classify Data (02) Predict Outcomes.
  
- Supervised learning can classify data like "W

- Unsupervised learning is used to predict undefined relationships like meaningful patterns in data.
- It is about creating computer algorithmes that can improve themselves.
- It is expected tht machine learning will shift to unsupervised learning to allow programmers to solve problems without creating models.

Reinforcement Learning:

- Reinforcement learning is based on non-supervised learning but receives feedback from the user whether the decisions is good or bad.
- The feedback contributes to improving the model.

Self-Supervised Learning:

- Self-supervised learning is similar to unsupervised learning because it works with data without human added labels.
- The difference is the unsupervised learning uses clustering, grouping and dimensionality reduction, while self-supervised learning draw its own
  conclusions for regression and classification tasks.
  
Key Machine Learning Terminologies are:

Relations , Labels,  Features, Models, Training, Inference 

1, Relationships:

- Machine Learning systems uses relationships between inputs to produce predications.

  In algebra, a relationship is often written as y = ax+b
  * y is the label we want to predict. * a is the slope of the line
  * x are the input values *b is the intercept

  With ML, a relationship is written as y = b + wx:
  * y is the label we want to predict * w is the weight (the slope)
  * x are features (input values) * b is the intercept.

2, Machine Learning Labels

- In Machine Learning terminology, the label is the thing we want to predict. 
  It is like the y in a linear graph:

  Algebra : y = ax + b   Machine Learning y = b + wa   
  
3, Machine Learning Feature

- In Machine Learning terminology, the features are the input
  They are like the x values in a linear graph:
  
  Algebra : y = ax + b   Machine Learning y = b + wx
  Some time there can be many features (input values) with different weights:
  
  y = b + w1x1 + w2x2 + w3x3 + w4x4
