- Up to 80% of a Machine Learning project is about collecting data.
* What data is Required
* What data is Available
* How to Select the data?
* How to collect the data?
* How to Clean the data?
* How to prepare the data?
* How to Use the data?

- What is Data?
  * Data can be many things.
  * With Machine learning, data is collecttion of facts:
  Numbers - Prices, Dates
  Measurements - Size, Height, Weight
  Words - Names and Places
  Observations - Counting Cars
  Descriptions - It is cold
  
- Intelligence Needs Data

  Human intelligence needs data:
  - A real estate broker needs data about the sold houses to estimate prices.
  - Artifical intelligence also needs data:
  - A Machine Learning program needs data to estimate prices.
  - Data can help us to see and understand
  - Data can help us to find new opportunities.
  - Data can help us to resolve misunderstandings.
  
- Health care
	
  Healthcare and life scienes collect public health data and patient data to learn how to improve patient care and save lives.
  
- Business 

  The most successful companies in many sectors are data driven. They use sophisticated data analytics to learn how the company can perform better.
  
- Finance

  Banks and insurance companies collect and evaluate data about customers, loans and deposits to support strategic decision-making
  
- Storing Data

*  The most common data to collect are Numbers and Measurements.
*  Often data are stored in arrays representing the relationship between values.
*  This table contains house prices versus size:
  Price  7  8 8 9 9 9 10 11 14 14 15
  Size   50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150
  
- Quantitative vs Qualitative

  *Quantitative data are numerical: 55 cars, 15 meters, 35 children
  *Qualitative data are descriptive: It is cold, it is long, it was fun
  
- Census or Sampling 

  * A census is when we collect data for every member of a group.
  * A Sample is when we collect data for some members of a group.
  * If we wanted to know how many Americans smoke cigarettes, we could ask every persoin in the US(a census), or we could ask 10000 people(a sample).
  * Census is Accurate, but hard to do. A sample is Inaccurate, but is easier to do.
  
- Sampling Terms
  * A population is group of individuals (objects) we want to collect information form
  * A Census is information about every individual in a population.
  * A Sample is information about a part of the population(In order to represent all).
  
- Random Samples 

   * In order for a sample to represent a population, it must be collected randomly.
   * A Random sample, is a sample where every member of the population has an equal chance to appear in the sample.
   
- Sampling Bias 

   * A sampling Bias(Error) occurs when samples are collected in such a way that some individuals are less(or more)
     likely to be included in the sample.
	 
- Big Data 

   * Big data is data that is impossible for humans to process without the assitance of advanced machines.
   * Big data does not have any definition in terms of size, but datasets are becoming larger and larger as we continously collect more and more data and 
     store data at a lower and lower cost.
	 
- Data Mining

   * With big data comes complicated data structures.
   * A huge part of big data processing is refining data.
