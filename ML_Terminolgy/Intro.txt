* Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial intelligence.

* Machine Learning (ML)

- Traditional programming uses known algorithms to produce results from data.
Data + Algorithms = Results

- Machine Learning creates new algorithms from data and results.
Data + Results = Algorithms

- Big Data, Deep Learning, and Strong AI ==> Neural Networks ==> Machine Learning ==>  Artifical Intelligence.

* Neural Networks 

- A programming technique.
- A method used in machine learning.
- A software that learns from mistakes.
- Neural Networks are based on how the human brain works.
- Neurons are sending messages to each other.
- While the neurons are trying to solve a problem(over and over again), it is strenghening the connections
  that lead to success and diminishing the connections that lead to failure.
  
* Perceptrons

- The Perceptron defines the first step into Neural Networks.
- It represents a single neuron with only one input layer, and no hidden layers.

* Neural Networks are multi-layer perceptrons
- In its simplest form,a neural network is made up from:
  (01) An input layer
  (02) A hidden layer
  (03) An output layer
- In the neural network model, input data are processed against a hidden layer before producing the final output.
- The First Layer: 
                  The input layer perceptrons are making simple decisions based on the input.
				  Each single decision is sent to the perceptrons in the next layer.
- The Second Layer:
                  The hidden layer perceptrons are making decisions by weighting the results from the first layer.
				  This layer make more complex decisions at a more abstract level than the first layer.

* Deep Neural Networks

- A programming technique.
- A method used in machine learning.
- A software that learns from mistakes.
- Deep Neural Networks are made up of several hidden layers of neural networks that perform complex operations on 
  massive amounts of data.
- Each successive layer uses the preceding layer as input.
- For instance, optical reading uses low layers to identify edges, and higher layers to identify letters.
- In the deep neural network model, input data are processed again a hidden layer and modified against more hidden layers to produce the final output.
- The First Layer:
				  The perceptrons are making simple decisions based on the input.
				  Each single decision is sent to the perceptrons in the next layer.
				  
- The Second Layer:
                  The perceptions are making decisions by weighting the results from the first layer.
				  This layer make more complex decisions at a more abstract level than the first layer.
				  
- The Third Layer:
				  Even more complex decisions are made by the perceptrons.
