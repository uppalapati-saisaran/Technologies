- Clusters are collections of similar data.
- Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning.
- The Correlation coefficient describes the strength of a relationship.

- Clusters

  * Clusters are collections of data based on similarity.
  * Data points clustered together in a graph can often be classified into clusters.

- Identifying Clusters

  * Clusters can hold a lot of valuable inforamtion, but clusters come in all sorts of shapes, so how can we recognize them?
  * The two main methods are:
  (01) Using visualization (02) Using an Clustering Algorithm
  
- Clustering 

  * Clustering is a type of Unsupervised Learning.
    - Collect similar data in groups
	- Collect dissimilar data in other groups.
	
- Clustering Methods

  * Density Method, Hierarchical Method, Partitioning Method, Grid-based Method
  (01) Density Method - considers points in a dense regions to have more similarties and difference than points in a lower dense region.
       The density method has a good accurancy. It also has the ability to merge clusters.
	   Two common algorithms are DBSCAN and OPTICS
  (02) Hierarchical Method - forms the clusters in a tree-type structure. New clusters are formed using previously formed clusters.
       Two common algorithms are CURE and BIRCH.
  (03) Grid-based Method - formulates the data into a finite number of cells that form a grid-like structure. 
       Two common algorithms are CLIQUE and STING
  (04) Partitioning Method - partitions the objects into k clusters and each partition forms one cluster.
       One common algorithm is CLARANS.
	   
- Correlation coefficient :

  * The correlation coefficient describes the strength and direction of a linear relationship and x/y variables on a scatterplot.
  * The value of r is always between -1 and +1
