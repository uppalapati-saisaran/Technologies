- NumPy is a Python library.
- NumPy is used for working with arrays.
- NumPy is short for "Numerical Python"

- Starting with a basic introduction and ends up with creating and plotting random data sets, and working with NumPy functions:


  Basic : Introduction, Getting Started, Creating Arrays, Array Indexing, Array Slicing, Data Types, Copy vs View, Array Shape,
          Array Reshape, Array Iterating, Array Join, Array Split, Array Search, Array Sort, Array Filter.
		 
  Random : Random Intro, Data Distribution, Random Permutation, Seaborn Module, Normal Dist, Binomial Dist, Poisson Dist, Uniform Dist,
           Logistic Dist, Multinomial Dist, Exponential Dis, Chi Square Dist, Rayleigh Dist, Pareto Dist, Zipf Dist.
		   

  ufunc : ufunc Intro, Create Function, Simple Arithmetic, Rounding Decimals, Logs, Summations, Products, Differences, Finding LCM
