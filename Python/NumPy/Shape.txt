// The shape of an array is the number of elements in each dimension.
// Numpy arrays have an attribute called shape that returns a tuple with each index 
   having the number of corresponding elements.
   
   import numpy as np
   arr = np.array([[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8]]])
   print(arr.shape)
   
Output: 
(2,4) 

// Create an array with 5 dimensions using ndmin using a vector with values 1,2,3,4 and verify that 
   last dimension has value 4:
   
   import numpy as np
   arr=np.array([1,2,3,4], ndmin=5)
   print(arr)
   print('shape of arary :', arr.shape)
   
Output:
[[[[[1 2 3 4]]]]]
shape of array : (1, 1, 1, 1, 4)
