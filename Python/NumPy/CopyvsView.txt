- The main difference between a copy and a view of an arrays is that the copy is a new array and the view is just a view of the original array.

- Make a copy, change the original array, and display both arrays:
- The copy SHOULD NOT be affected by the changes made to the original array.

import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
x = arr.copy()
arr[0] = 42
print(arr)
print(x)

- Make a view, change the original array, and display both arrays:
- The view SHOULD be affected by the changes made to the original array. 
- The original array should be affected by the changes made to the view. 

import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
x = arr.view()
arr[0] = 42
print(arr)
print(x) 
x [0] = 31
print(arr)
print(x)

- Check if Array Owns its Data
- Every NumPy array has the attribute base that returns None if the array owns the data.
  Otherwise, the base attribute refers to the original object.
- Print the value of the base attribute to check if an array owns it's data or not:

import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
x = arr.copy()
y = arr.view() 

print(x.base)
print(y.base)   
  
Output:
None
[1 2 3 4 5]
