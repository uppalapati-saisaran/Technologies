- NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.

- It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.

- It is open source project and you can use it freely.


Why use NumPy?

- In  Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.
- NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.

- The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.

- Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.

- Data Science: is a branch of computer science where we study how to store, use and analyze data for deriving information from it.

Why is NumPy Faster Than Lists?

- NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.

- This behaviour is called locality of reference in computer science.

- This is the main reason why NumPy is faster than lists. Also it is optimized to work with latest CPU architectures.

Which language is NumPy written in?

- NumPy is a Python library and is written partically in Python, but most of the parts that require fast computation are written in C or C++.
