Function Polymorphism:

- An example of a Python function that can be used on different objects is the len() function.

String 

- For strings len() returns the number of characters:

  x = "Hello world!"
  print(len(x)) 
  
  Output:
  12

Tuple 

- For tuples len() returns the number of items in the tuple:

  mytuple=("apple","banana","cherry")
  print(len(mytuple)) 
  
  Output:
  3
  
Dictionary

- For dictionaries len() returns the number of key/value pairs in the dictionary:

  thisdict = {
  "brand":"Ford",
  "model","Mustang",
  "year":1964
  }
  
  print(len(thisdict)) 
  
  Output:
  3
  
Class Polymorphism :

- Polymorphism is often used in Class methods, where we can have multiple classes with the same method name.
- Example, say we have three classes: Car, Boat, and Plane, and they all have a method called move():

class Car:
	def __init__(self,brand,model):
	   self.brand = brand
	   self.model = model
	
	def move(self):
		print("Drive!")
		
class Boat:
	def __init__(self,brand,model):
		self.brand = brand
		self.model = model
		
	def move(self):
		print("Sai!")
		
class Plane:
	def __init__(self,brand,model):
		self.brand = brand
		self.model = model
	
	def move(self):
	    print("Fly!"
		
car1 = Car("Ford","Mustang")   # Create a Car class
boat1 = Boat("Ibiza","Touring 20") # Create a Boat class
plane1 = Plane("Boeing","747")  # Create a plane class

for x in (car1,boat1,plane1):
	x.move()
	

Inheritance class Polymorphism:

Parent class called Vehicle, and make Car, Boat, Plane child classes of 
Vehicle, the child classes inherits the Vehicle methods, but can override them:

class Vehicle:
	def __init__(self,brand,model):
		self.brand = brand
		self.model = model 
		
	def move(self):
		print("Move!")
		
class Car(Vehicle):
	pass
	
class Boat(Vehicle):
	def move(self):
		print("Sai1!")
	
class Plane(Vehicle):
	def move(self):
		print("Fly!")
		
car1= Car("Ford","Mustang") # Create a Car class
boat1 = Boat("Ibiza","Touring 20") # Create a Boat object
plane1 = Plane("Boeing","747")# Create a Plane object

for x in (car1,boat1,plane1):
	print(x.brand)
	print(x.model)
	x.move()

Output: 
	
Ford
Mustang
Move!
Ibiza
Touring 20
Sail!
Boeing
747
Fly!
