Local scope:

- A variable created inside a function belongs to the local scope of that function, 
  and can only be used inside that function.
  
  def myfun():
	x = 300
	print(x)
	
  myfunc() 
  
Function inside Function:

- The variable x is not available outside the function, but it is available for any function  
  inside the function. 

  def myfunc():
	x = 300
	def myinnerfunc():
		print(x)
    myinnerfunc()
	
  myfunc()
