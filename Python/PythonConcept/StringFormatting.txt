- The format() method allows you to format selected parts of a string.

- Input come from a database or user input? To control such values, add placeholders (curly brackets {} ) in the text,
  and run the values through the format() method.
  
- Add a placeholder where you want to display the price:

  price = 49
  txt = "The price is {} dollars"
  print(txt.format(price)) 
  
  
  The price is 49 dollars
  
- Format the price to be displayed as a number with two decimals:
  
  txt = "The price is {:.2f} dollars"
  
  The price is 49.00 dollars
  
- Add more placeholders
  
  quantity = 3
  itemno = 567
  price = 49
  myorder = "I want {} pieces of item numer {} for {:.2f} dollars."
  print(order.format(quantity,itemno,price)) 
  
  I want 3 pieces of item number 567 for 49.00 dollars.
  
- use Index numbers to be usre that values are placed in the correct placeholders:

  quantity = 3
  itemno = 567
  price = 49
  myorder = "I want {0} pieces of item number {1} for {2:.2f} dollars."
  
  print(myorder.format(quantity,itemno,price))
  
- If you want to refer to the same value more than once, use the index number 
  
  age = 36
  name = "John"
  txt = "His name is {1}. {1} is {0] years old."
  print(txt.format(age,name))
  
  His name is John. John is 36 years old. 
  
- Named indexes 

  myorder = "I have a {carname}, it is a {model}."
  print(myorder.format(carname="Ford",model="Mustang")
  
  I have a Ford, it is a Mustang.
