  // file is located in the same folder as Python
  f = open("demofile.txt","r")
  print(f.read())
  
  // if the file is located in a different location,
     you will have to specify the file path.
  f = open("D:\\myfiles\welcome.txt","r")
  print(f.read())
  
  // By default the read() method returns the whole text,
  but you can also specify how many characters you want
  to return.
  f=open("demofile.txt","r")
  print(f.read(5))
  
Read Lines:

- You can return one line by using the readline() method:
- By calling readline() two times, you can read the two first lines.
  f = open("demofile.tx","r")
  print(f.readline()) 
  
  
- By looping through the lines of the file, you can read the
  whole file, line by line:
  
  f = open("demofile.txt","r")
  for x in f:
	print(x)
