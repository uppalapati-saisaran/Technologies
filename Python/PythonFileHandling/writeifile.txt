// Open the file and append content to the file:

f = open("demofile2.txt","a")
f.write("Now the file has more content!")
f.close(()

#open and read the file after the appending:
f = open("demofile2.txt","r")
print(f.read())


// Open th file "demofile3.txt" and overwrite the content:

f = open("demofile3.txt","w")
f.write("Woops! I have deleted the content!")
f.close()

#Open and read the file after the overwriting:
f = open("demofile3.txt","r")
print(f.read()) 

// Create a file called "myfile.txt":
f = open("myfile.txt","x")
Result: a new empty file is created!
